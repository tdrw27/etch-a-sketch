# Etch A Sketch

This is my etch-a-sketch project submission for The Odin Project. It relies heavily on css animations, so browser addons do not play well with the web app, especially dark mode addons! Please disable browser addons to experience the app how it was intended.

## To use

- Open the github deployment

OR

- Clone the repo to a folder on your computer
- Open the index in your browser

### Instructions

- Click the buttons along the top to change the size of the drawing area.

- To reset the drawing area, use a new size or click the same size you are currently using.

- There is a color picker for the background and line, and don't forget to check out the special effects!

- My favortite effects:
    - pulse
    - rainbow-line
    - redraw
